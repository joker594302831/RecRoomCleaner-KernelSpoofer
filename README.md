Cleans all trackers of recroom and EAC, also spoofs your device from EAC

.net 6.0 required https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.406-windows-x64-installer

How to use:
If u want to clean and spoof type 1. if u just want to spoof from EAC type 2.

This is for advanced use and only use it if u need to and neptunes unbanner does not work.

The spoofer uses a driver which is called EACSpoof.sys and is mapped with a manual mapper which i named to EACSpoof.exe i do not know what is in the driver mapper but im pretty sure its safe.
The driver basically changes all of ur hwid and stuff like that to a null value so basically eac cant recognize ur device at all.
